This challenge is a drivative of the original 75 Hard Challenge for doing research work. In this blog I focus on Artificial Intelligence but one can choose to apply the rules on their choice of area like Medicine, Maths Spirituality or even fiction!

**Vision**

To learn to grind through a difficult task while improving on research skills.

**Goals:**

Upon completion of the course you should be able to:
- Sit down and study <b>at will</b>.
- Understand research papers at a <b>deeper level</b>.
- <b>Feel confident</b> in your ability to pick up anything and finish it.
- <b>Not sway away</b> at the whims of your mind or any social media AI algorithm.


**Rules:**
There are only three rules. Everyday one has to do,
- <b>3 hours self-study:</b> This is other than whatever existing commitments like university or job you have.
- <b>15 minutes book reading:</b> Any non-technical book.
- <b>5 + 5 minute meditation:</b> 5 minutes in the morning, 5 minutes in the evening.

**Contact:** For any help and query, write to 75hardresearch@gmail.com.
