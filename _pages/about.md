This challenge is a derivative of the original 75 Hard Challenge, but it focuses on research rather than physical activities. While my primary focus is on Artificial Intelligence, you can adapt the rules to any area of interest—be it Medicine, Mathematics, Spirituality, or even Fiction!

This website serves as a supportive resource for my **[Youtube-Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@75HardResearch)**, from where I started this journey.
